it popular?\n","  - Python is a high level versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability it is popular due to its easy to lear syntax, vast labraries, used in data science, AI and automation\n","\n","2.What is interpreter in python?\n","  - An interpreter in python is a program that executes pyton code line by line transalating it into machine readble instructions at runtime\n","\n","3.What are predefined keywords in python?\n","  - Pre defiend keywords in python are reserved words that have special meanings and are part of the language synatx they canoot be used as variable or functions name\n","\n","4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  - No keywords cannot b used as variable name in python they are reserved words with predefined meanings and specific roles in the languages syntax using them as variable names will result in a syntax error\n","\n","5.What is mutability in python?\n","  - Mutability in python refers to whether an objects state its content can be modified after it has been created\n","\n","6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are\n","  immutable?\n","  - Lists are mutable because they are designed for dynamic collections where elements can be added, removed or modified this flexibility makes them ideal for situations where frequent changes are needed\n","  - Tuples are immutable because they are inteded for fixed unchanging collections of data their immutability ensures data integrity allows them to be used as dictionary keys and makes them more memory efficient and faster for access\n","\n","7.What is the difference between \"==\" and\n","  \"is\" operators in python\n","  - == Compares the values of two object for equality\n","  \"is\" checks if two objects refer to the same memory location identity\n","\n","8.What are logical operators in python?\n","  - Logical operators in python are used to combine conditional statements or expressions and return a boolean result they evaluates the truthness of expressions\n","\n","9.What is type casting?\n","  - Where data type is converted one form to another\n","\n","10.What is the difference between implicit\n","   and explicit type castng?\n","   - Implicit type casting~python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another during operations\n","   - Explicit type casting~The programmer manually converts a data type using type conversion functions like int float str\n","\n","11.What is the purpose of conditional\n","   statements in python?\n","   - The purpose is to execute specific blocks of code if its condition evaluates to true skipping the rest\n","\n","12.How does the elif statement work?\n","   - The elif statement checks multiple conditions sequentially and executes its block of code if its condition evaluates to true skipping the rest\n","\n","13.What is the difference between for and\n","   while loops\n","   - for loop~ Iterates over a sequence for a fixed number of iterations.\n","   - while loop~Repeats as long as a specified condition remains true, ideal for indefinite loops\n","\n","14.Describes a scenario where a while loop\n","   is more suitable than a for loop\n","   - A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condtion being met, such as reading input until the user enters a specific value or processing data until a certain thresold is reached"],"metadata":{"id":"ZudtN_nJTqVQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions\n"],"metadata":{"id":"sQjubxLrfrzD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.Write a
